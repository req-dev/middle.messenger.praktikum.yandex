## Description

Chat with friends, colleagues, meet new people — you can do all of it in "Chat."
You can create groups with an unlimited number of participants!
There are no restrictions on topics of discussion.
**We don't moderate or censor chats** (because we don't have money for that).
Feel free to talk about anything and enjoy the cool dark design of the app!
